## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

Optiply has established itself as a leading **inventory optimization SaaS** platform, helping customers make intelligent purchase order decisions with seamless ERP integration. However, critical gaps in our end-to-end workflow prevent us from delivering the complete automation our customers need—and our competitors are rapidly closing in with AI-powered solutions.

### The Problem

Despite our strong inventory optimization core, customers still face significant manual work:

- **Double data entry**: Orders placed in Optiply sync to ERP ✓, but customers must manually re-enter data in supplier portals ✗
- **Manual supplier communication**: Reading and processing supplier emails takes 10-15 minutes each
- **Expensive EDI processing**: Third-party processors cost thousands monthly with slow turnaround
- **Time-consuming invoice matching**: 30-60 minutes per invoice for 3-way verification
- **Disconnected logistics**: No integration between inventory optimization and container/freight management

These gaps cost our customers **6-8 hours per day** in manual work and prevent us from winning larger enterprise deals.

### The Solution: 5 Strategic Growth Initiatives

We will deliver **end-to-end supply chain automation** through five integrated initiatives:

1. **AI-Powered PO Data Input** (Deck Partnership) - Q1-Q2
  - Eliminates double data entry in supplier portals
  - 90% time reduction (20-30 min → 2-3 min per PO)
2. **Supplier Email Analysis** - Q2
  - Automated extraction of availability, pricing, lead time changes
  - 90% time reduction (10-15 min → 1-2 min per email)
3. **In-House EDI Integration** - Q2-Q3
  - Replace expensive third-party processor
  - 100% cost savings + real-time processing
4. **3-Way Matching Automation** - Q3-Q4
  - Automated PO/GRN/Invoice verification
  - 95% time reduction (30-60 min → 1-2 min per invoice)
5. **Container Optimization Pilot** - Q3-Q4
  - Smart container filling with freight forwarder partnerships
  - 15-30% logistics cost reduction + new revenue stream

**Conservative Target: €250-300K (assumes 70-80% achievement rate)**

**Detailed Revenue Drivers:**

**1. Deck PO Automation (€75-100K)**

- **Mechanism**: Eliminates double data entry → enables enterprise upsells
- **Target**: 5-10 enterprise customers @ €10-20K increase
- **Rationale**: Enterprise customers pay premium for complete automation
- **Timeline**: Q2-Q3 upsells close, Q4 revenue recognized

**2. Email Analysis (€60-90K)**

- **Mechanism**: Auto-apply supplier updates → reduces churn
- **Target**: Save 3-5 customers from churning @ €20-30K ARR each
- **Rationale**: Customers churn due to manual work; automation increases stickiness
- **Timeline**: Q2-Q3 retention improvements measurable

**3. EDI Integration (€50-75K)**

- **Mechanism**: In-house EDI → premium feature upsell
- **Target**: 10-15 customers @ €5-10K premium
- **Rationale**: Customers currently pay third-party €6-18K/year; we offer better value
- **Timeline**: Q3-Q4 upsells as third-party contracts expire

**4. 3-Way Matching (€45-75K)**

- **Mechanism**: Automated invoice matching → enterprise expansion
- **Target**: 3-5 new enterprise customers @ €15-25K ARR
- **Rationale**: Enterprise customers need invoice automation for scale
- **Timeline**: Q3-Q4 new customer acquisition

**5. Container Optimization (€120-288K) - HIGHEST POTENTIAL**

- **Mechanism**: Marketplace model with freight forwarder partnerships
- **Economics**:
  - Customer pays: €2,000 (vs. €3,000 direct) = **€1,000 savings (33%)**
  - Optiply pays: €1,500 to freight forwarder
  - Gross profit: **€500-800 per container**
- **Target**: 10-15 customers booking 20-30 containers/month
- **Assumptions**:
  - Average customer books 2-3 containers/month
  - 10-15 active customers = 20-45 containers/month
  - Conservative: 20-30 containers/month @ €500-800 = €10-24K/month = **€120-288K/year**
- **Timeline**: Q2 first containers, Q3-Q4 scale to 20-30/month
