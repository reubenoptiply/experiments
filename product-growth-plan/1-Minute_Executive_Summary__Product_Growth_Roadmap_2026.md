## Product Growth Strategy: 1-Minute Overview

---

## 🎯 Product Growth Vision

**Transform Optiply from inventory optimization tool → AI-powered operating system for end-to-end supply chain management**

---

## ❌ The Problem

Customers love our inventory optimization, but still waste **6-8 hours/day** on manual work:
- ❌ Double data entry (Optiply → ERP ✓, but manual supplier portal entry ✗)
- ❌ Manual email processing (supplier updates, availability, pricing)
- ❌ Expensive third-party EDI ($XXX,XXX/year)
- ❌ Time-consuming invoice matching (30-60 min each)
- ❌ No logistics optimization (high shipping costs)

**Result:** We're losing enterprise deals to competitors promising complete automation.
