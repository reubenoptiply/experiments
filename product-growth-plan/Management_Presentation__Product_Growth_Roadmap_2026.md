## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

Optiply has established itself as a leading **inventory optimization SaaS** platform, helping customers make intelligent purchase order decisions with seamless ERP integration. However, critical gaps in our end-to-end workflow prevent us from delivering the complete automation our customers need—and our competitors are rapidly closing in with AI-powered solutions.

### The Problem

Despite our strong inventory optimization core, customers still face significant manual work:
- **Double data entry**: Orders placed in Optiply sync to ERP ✓, but customers must manually re-enter data in supplier portals ✗
- **Manual supplier communication**: Reading and processing supplier emails takes 10-15 minutes each
- **Expensive EDI processing**: Third-party processors cost thousands monthly with slow turnaround
- **Time-consuming invoice matching**: 30-60 minutes per invoice for 3-way verification
- **Disconnected logistics**: No integration between inventory optimization and container/freight management

These gaps cost our customers **6-8 hours per day** in manual work and prevent us from winning larger enterprise deals.

### The Solution: 5 Strategic Growth Initiatives

We will deliver **end-to-end supply chain automation** through five integrated initiatives:

1. **AI-Powered PO Data Input** (Deck Partnership) - Q1-Q2
   - Eliminates double data entry in supplier portals
   - 90% time reduction (20-30 min → 2-3 min per PO)

2. **Supplier Email Analysis** - Q2
   - Automated extraction of availability, pricing, lead time changes
   - 90% time reduction (10-15 min → 1-2 min per email)

3. **In-House EDI Integration** - Q2-Q3
   - Replace expensive third-party processor
   - 100% cost savings + real-time processing

4. **3-Way Matching Automation** - Q3-Q4
   - Automated PO/GRN/Invoice verification
   - 95% time reduction (30-60 min → 1-2 min per invoice)

5. **Container Optimization Pilot** - Q3-Q4
   - Smart container filling with freight forwarder partnerships
   - 15-30% logistics cost reduction + new revenue stream
