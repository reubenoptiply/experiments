**retool_simulation_block.py** — Older “paste-ready” Retool Python block that uses **synthetic** demand (base demand from price, scenarios like Stable Fast, Seasonal, etc.). Superseded by the implementation in **retool-blocks/**: [simulate_stocks.py](../../retool-blocks/simulate_stocks.py) uses **real** sales from `fetch_daily_sales` and product archetypes from `fetch_product_meta`; use that for the current workflow.
