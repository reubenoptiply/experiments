# Demo Account Simulator (Optiply Shop 1380)

This project is worked on by both Cursor and Gemini CLI. Keep [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) and the root README in sync when you change scope or API.

## Spec and plan

- **Spec (authoritative):** @CONTEXT.md
- **Current improvement plan (what to implement):** @PLAN.md

When implementing, follow the plan in PLAN.md. If you change scope or the API, update the plan or CONTEXT.md accordingly. Whenever you make a change, update CONTEXT.md (especially §8 Implementation status) so we know what's going on.
